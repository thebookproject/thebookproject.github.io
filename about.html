        <p class="description">Greetings from The Book Project team!</p>
        <p class="description">We are a team of super dedicated volunteers who wish to collect a substantial amount to help migrant workers and other people suffering due to Corona. We wish to start with donating to the cyclone relief teams in Bengal at this point.
          Along with that, we wish to help give wings to budding artists, writers etc and get an e-book published towards the end of the year. We bring to you a team of writers, poets, editors, artists and content curators.</p>

        <h3 class="name"><strong>How we work</strong></h3>
        <p class="description">For every single write up/ post we get, the artist donates a small token amount which we collect and donate to an NGO working for these people. 80% of the amount will go towards philanthropic initiatives and the remaining 20% will
          be to cover our expenses. We are also keeping the option open to others who wish to donate through us and support our cause.&nbsp;</p>
